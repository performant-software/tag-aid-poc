This is an experimental interface for viewing variant text. Development was begun at the [Huygens Institute](http://huygens.knaw.nl/) in early 2016 in the context of a design sprint centred around the concept of "text-as-graph", particularly as used in the [Stemmaweb](https://stemmaweb.net/) tools.

This fork has updated the original proof of concept to use live data, and reworked it to be supported by the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) infrastructure.

## Requirements

-   Node.JS 14+, npm 7+
-   Python 3
-   [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

Within the root directory, install dependencies required to run the application:

```sh
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

1. Within the root directory, create a new file named `.env`. **It is highly recommended that this file be git-ignored in order to avoid committing sensitive data into version control.**

2. In the newly created `.env` file, add the following environment variables:

-   **`PUBLIC_URL`**
    -   Ex: `PUBLIC_URL=enter_url_here_with_no_spaces_or_quotes`
-   **`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN`**
    -   Ex: `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=enter_token_here_with_no_spaces_or_quotes`
    -   A Mapbox token can be obtained from the [Mapbox website](www.mapbox.com) - see the "Access tokens" section of your Mapbox account page.
-   **`REACT_APP_HOMEPATH`**
    -   Ex: `REACT_APP_HOMEPATH=/ChronicleME/`

### API Configuration

1. Within the `/script` directory, create a new file named `lemma-html-config.json`. **It is highly recommended that this file be git-ignored in order to avoid committing sensitive data into version control** - this is why we provide an example file (`lemma-html-config.json.example`), rather than the file itself, on GitHub.

2. In the newly created `lemma-html-config.json` file, add a JSON object with the following keys (be sure to update with your own values):

```json
{
    "options": {
        "repository": "repository URL goes inside these quotes",
        "tradition_id": "tradition ID goes inside these quotes"
    },
    "auth": {
        "username": "API auth username goes inside these quotes",
        "password": "API auth password goes inside these quotes"
    }
}
```

**Note** - an example file, `lemma-html-config.json.example`, has been provided as an example.

### Data Generation

Within the root directory, run the following command:

```sh
node script/generateAllData.js
```

## Local Development

Run the application locally:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Deploying

**Within the project root directory:**

```
npm run build
zip -r <buildID> build
scp <buildID>.zip <user>:<pass>@<hostname>:<path>
```

For Stemmaweb, the final argument should be something like `edition@monitor.stemmaweb.net:.`.

**On the server:**

```rm -rf build
unzip <buildID>
rm -rf www/*
cp -r build/* www
```
